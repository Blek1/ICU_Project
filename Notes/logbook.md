# Logbook
This will be a log of everything I look up/research. I will report any major findings from my work and use this logbook as a notebook for my own notes to assist in my learning. I will consolidate all things here and hope to have a standardized format for note-taking.

* **BOLD** will be used for either keywords, emphasis or when there are multiple options and I chose one of the paths


## Project 1
### Prereqs
* Opened a new folder in WSL for setting up Kubernetes
* Created a new AWS account
* Installed AWS on WSL
* Configured AWS (There are 2 ways to do this)
    * **Using AWS configure command**
        * stroes credentials in a file at `~/.aws/credentials` and output config in `~/.aws/config`
        * This prompts me for:
            * AWS Access key ID
            * AWS Secret access Key
            * Default region name
            * Default output format
        * Easy setup and persistent across shell sessions BUT can get messy with multiple profiles
    * Using CLI environ variables

Setting up git
* Set up repo and connected it to github desktop
* Connected my Ubuntu to git using the CLI
    * Set my environment username and email
    * Set my SSH and HTTPS both up
        * Apparently it is common practice to use both
        * SSH is better for when you want to generate an SSH key once and forget about it. No more token prompts, easy commit signing, and your key never expires
        * HTTPS is hassle-free because port 443 is always open and you can cut a tokenâ€™s scope to just one repo if you like
        * `origin` is used for SSH
        * `https` is for remote fallback (especially if there is an active network firewall)
